This is my personal blog. I will post some information that I find useful.
The information is generally about embedded software, hardware, Linux and
open source.

I'm a full time software engineer. I live in Ukraine and work as an embedded
software engineer for a local company. In my free time I like to mess around
with hardware, develop or modify some devices for fun and profit.

Recently I also got into reverse engineering. It started as reversing some
of binary libraries of SDK for esp8266 chip. I plan to continue getting
involved into RE field.

The main goal of creating this blog is to store some information for my own
usage. And as I am a big supporter of open-source community I decided to share
the information with the community.

All the information in this blog provided "as-is", without any warranty.
I do not take responsibility for any consequences of its usage.

You can find the source code for most posts at my github page:
